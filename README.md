# Exam 2 - Online Shop - 

My second exam attempt. Building a simple e-commerce website with JavaScript and the Noroff API as I had missunderstod the the exam at first.

## What This Project Does

This is a basic online shop where users can:

- Register and login with their @stud.noroff.no email
- Browse products from the Noroff API
- Add items to a shopping cart
- View and manage their cart

## Files in This Project

- `index.html` - The main homepage
- `shop.html` - Shows all the products
- `cart.html` - Shopping cart page
- `login.html` - Login and register forms
- `css/styles.css` - All the styling
- `js/api.js` - Handles API calls and login stuff
- `js/shop.js` - Makes the shop page work

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Go to the login page and create an account (need @stud.noroff.no email)
3. Browse products on the shop page
4. Add items to cart and view them on the cart page

## What I Used

- **HTML** - For the page structure
- **CSS** - For styling (background color is #faf7f0)
- **JavaScript** - For making it interactive
- **Noroff API** - For user accounts and products

## Help I Got

- **Cart Design**: Used ideas from a Designmodo tutorial (https://designmodo.com/shopping-cart-ui/)
- **API Setup**: Followed my teacher's guide for connecting to the Noroff API
- **Planning**: Got help organizing my project with proper documentation
-**Teachers guaidence**: Help with the API setup 

## What I Learned

- How to connect to APIs with JavaScript
- Creating a carosel 
- Making forms for login and registration
- Storing user data in the browser
- Creating a shopping cart that remembers items
- Making websites work on phones and computers
- Not to blindly trust that AI has all the right anwsers


## Notes

This is my second try at this exam. I learned a lot about JavaScript and APIs. All the actual coding was done by me, but I got help understanding how to organize a project properly. Some help with coding I could not make work or understand with AI. This also showed me one can not rely blindly on AI help. But at the same time I learnd how to work with AI and how to use it sensebly. 
Since I missunderstood my exam for so many weeks I have worked extremly hard to cath up and get everything back on track. I had to redo the Figma design, projectboard. Some of the code I could reuse.
