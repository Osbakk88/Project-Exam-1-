# My Exam 2 Project Plan (This document is created with the help of AI)

## What I Need to Build

I need to make an online shop website for my exam. Here's what I planned to do:

## 0. Design Phase (Required)

### High-Fidelity Figma Design

- **Required by exam**: 
- Had to create high-fidelity Figma prototype
- Spent about 2 weeks designing the complete website in Figma
- Made detailed wireframes and mockups for all pages (login, register, shop, cart)
- Designed responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Chose color scheme, typography, and spacing
- Created interactive prototype showing user flow
- This was a separate deliverable that had to be completed before coding
- Made the actual HTML/CSS coding much easier because I knew exactly what to build

## 1. User Login Stuff

### Make a Register Page

- Users can sign up with their @stud.noroff.no email
- Need a form with email, username, and password
- Check if email is correct format
- Show error if something's wrong
- Take me about 1-2 days

### Make a Login Page

- Users can log in with email and password
- Save their login so they don't have to log in again
- Redirect to shop page when logged in
- Maybe 1 day of work

## 2. Homepage

### Make Homepage with Carousel

- Create main landing page that welcomes users
- Add image carousel/slider to show featured products or promotions
- Make navigation menu to other pages (shop, login, cart)
- Show site name/logo clearly
- Make it look professional and inviting
- Carousel was tricky to get working smoothly
- Took about 1-2 days to get everything looking right

## 3. Shop Page

### Show All Products

- Get products from the Noroff API
- Show them in a nice grid
- Each product needs image, name, and price
- Make it work on phones too
- Probably 1-2 days

### Add to Cart Button

- Button on each product to add to cart
- Save items in browser storage
- Show user something happened when they click
- Maybe half a day

## 4. Shopping Cart

### Make Cart Page Look Good

- Used ideas from a tutorial online (Designmodo)
- Show products in cart with pictures and prices
- Buttons to change quantity (+ and -)
- Button to remove items
- Show total price
- This was the hardest part, took about 2-3 days

### Make Cart Work Properly

- Save cart items so they don't disappear
- Let people change how many they want
- Remove items if they don't want them
- Calculate total price correctly
- About 1 day

## 5. Make It Look Nice

### Basic Design

- Choose colors that look good together
- Make text big enough to read
- Make it work on phones
- Keep it simple and clean
- Maybe 1 day

## 6. Connect Everything

### Make API Work

- Learn how to get data from Noroff API
- Handle errors when internet is slow
- Save user login information
- This was confusing at first, took about 2 days

## 7. Extra Things I Could Add Later (if time)

### Maybe Add Header/Footer

- Simple header with site name and navigation
- Footer with basic info
- Only if main features work first
- Maybe 1 day

### Better Error Messages

- Show nicer messages when things go wrong
- Help users understand what to do
- Maybe half a day

## What I Learned

- How to create high-fidelity designs in Figma (this was required and new for me)
- The importance of designing everything before coding - made development so much smoother
- How to make responsive designs that work on all screen sizes
- How to create image carousels/sliders with JavaScript
- How to use APIs (still learning this)
- JavaScript is harder than I thought
- Following your design exactly when coding is important
- Testing on different browsers is important
- Professional workflow: Design → Prototype → Code → Test

## Problems I Had

1. **API was confusing** - Had to follow teacher's guide exactly
2. **Cart kept losing items** - Learned about localStorage
3. **Design looked bad on phones** - Added responsive CSS
4. **Buttons were different sizes** - Fixed with better CSS
5. **Learnd about the use of !important in CSS** - Never knew this before!

## Time It Actually Took

- **First 2 weeks**: High-fidelity Figma design (required deliverable)
  - Created complete prototype (Did a lot of changes and still is unsure about my design since i missunderstood and this is my second take)
- **Week 3**: Login and register pages (following Figma designs)
- **Week 4**: Shop page and API connection
- **Week 5**: Shopping cart (this was hard!)
- **Week 6**: Making it look better and fixing bugs

This plan was not followd to the point I wish. I had to take some breakes and start at diffrent pionts in the assignment. So I dont feel as structured as I would like. 

## Help I Got

- **Teacher's API guide** - Showed me exactly how to connect
- **Designmodo tutorial** - For cart design ideas (combined with my Figma designs)
- **AI help** - For organizing this document and understanding concepts in codeing. It has been a very usefull tool. But I see that I can not be used without guaidance and understanding. 

All the actual coding was done by me, but I got help understanding how to organize and plan properly from my assignment, the teacher and AI.

**Note**: This is my second attempt at this exam. I learned a lot more about JavaScript and APIs this time!
